# Data Manipulation with JavaScript ES6

This directory contains JavaScript code examples for manipulating data using the latest features of the ECMAScript 6 (ES6) language standard.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the data-manipulation-es6 directory. You will need a modern JavaScript runtime, such as Node.js, to run the examples.

git clone https://github.com/godfreylehokoG/alx-backend-javascript
cd 0x03-ES6_data_manipulation

## Examples

The following examples are included in this directory:

    array-methods.js: Examples of using the new array methods introduced in ES6, such as Array.from(), Array.of(), and Array.find().
    iteration-methods.js: Examples of using the new iteration methods introduced in ES6, such as Array.entries(), Array.keys(), and Array.values().
    object-destructuring.js: Examples of using object destructuring to extract values from objects and arrays.
    spread-operator.js: Examples of using the spread operator (...) to spread arrays and objects into individual elements or properties.

To run an example, use the node command followed by the example file name:

node array-methods.js
